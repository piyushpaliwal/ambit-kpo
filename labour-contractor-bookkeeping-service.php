                    <p>Contractors have to think about tons of financial factors from billing to the cost of labor and
                        production. And since contractors work on a project basis, things are always changing. That’s
                        why it’s so important that you and your team not only understand accounting best practices but
                        have specialized knowledge of the construction industry too. The success of your business and
                        the satisfaction of your clients rely on knowing construction accounting basics—but if you don’t
                        have a financial background, it can feel like an uphill battle.
