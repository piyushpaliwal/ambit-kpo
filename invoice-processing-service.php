            <h2>Our 3-step Approach to Invoice Processing</h2>
            <p>Years of experience has enabled us to fine tune a thorough, streamlined process for invoice processing.
                There is a reason why our clients are satisfied with our services, and keep coming back to us with their
                requirements</p>
            <h4>1. Invoices Received</h4>
            <p>We receive your invoices once they are uploaded to our secure FTP server and check the data to ensure
                that it is accurate. We support multiple file formats including XML, so our clients never face an issue.
                You can even send in the invoices as email attachments.</p>
            <h4>2. Invoice Processing</h4>
            <p>Our professional invoice processors receive your invoices and check the contents for accuracy and
                completeness. Invoices are separated based on their complexity, and our quality control procedure
                ensures that in case of any doubt, the invoices are checked and verified for accuracy after taking
                suggestions from the client.</p>
            <h4>3. Invoices Sent</h4>
            <p>Once thoroughly checked, the invoices are imported into an accounts payable system of our own choice, and
                in a format you are comfortable with. The whole process is extremely streamlined and secure so as to
                ensure guaranteed delivery before due time.</p>
