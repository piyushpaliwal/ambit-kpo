            <h4>Step 1 (Purchase Requisition)</h4>
            <p>The First step in an Accounts payable process is the receipt of Purchase Requisition from the Purchase
                Department with specifications and quantity defined and the names of the recommended vendors with the
                name of the vendor most suitable for the purchase and reasons for their recommendation. </p>
            <h4>Step 2 (Issue of Purchase Order)
            </h4>
            <p>The Next step is the issue of Purchase Order in favour of the Vendor and on terms as defined in the
                Purchase Requisition. The Accounts payable team needs to ensure that none of the terms mentioned in the
                PO are violative of the company policies and the due process of approval has been followed.
            </p>
            <h4>Step 3 (Receipt of Goods)</h4>
            <p>On receipt of goods the GRN (goods received note) should be prepared, and the goods quantity and
                specifications should be checked with the PO and adverse observations to be reported to the management
                as well as the vendor. The Quality control team should carry out their due diligence and submit their
                report to the Purchase Department.
            </p>
            <h4>Step 4 (Invoice Verification)
            </h4>
            <p>Based on inputs from the Quality control team, management and Purchase order issued the purchase
                department needs to verify the invoice received in terms of quantity, quality, taxes, payment terms etc.
                The Purchase department should then forward the same to the accounts team for processing the payment
                based on agreed terms.</p>
            <h4>Step 5 (Accounting)</h4>
            <p>The accounts department after receipt of the invoice duly verified and processed from purchase takes the
                same into the books of account and creates the due date of payment along with tax liability if any. This
                helps the finance department in analysing the funds flow position of the company.</p>
            <h4>Step 6 (Release of Payment)</h4>
            <p>The accounts department based of advice from the management and looking to the funds flow position
                releases the payment to the vendor as per agreed terms in one single go or on periodicity as may be
                decided.</p>
            <h4>Step 7 (Bank Payment & Reconciliation)</h4>
            <p>Once the release order is issued the Finance Department issues the payment to the vendor. Many companies
                do involve their internal audit department at the release of payment stage also to avoid any issues at a
                future date.</p>
