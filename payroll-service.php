                <h3>Payroll entries</h3>
                <p>Payroll is one of the most regular compliance which the employers need to fulfil to avoid any
                    penalties at a future date. Recording of Payroll in a timely and proper manner helps in issuance of
                    W2 before the deadline.</p>
                <p>One of the most crucial aspects of Payroll is the Payroll Processing Company and its reports. The
                    recording of payroll and payment of taxes is purely dependent on the reports generated from the
                    software on Pay period basis and on how accurately the business records payroll information on the
                    software.</p>
                <p>Payroll journal entries are used to record the compensation paid to employees.</p>
                <p> <strong>The Initial Payroll Journal Entry is to record the Gross Wages, Taxes payable by the
                        Employer, Tax deductions on behalf of Employee, contributions towards social security, pension,
                        medical etc and the net wages payable.</strong> </p>
