                    <p>Construction accounting is complex. It involves huge costs, multiple vendors, crews and clients
                        that require equal attention to ensure that associated expenses, cost and incomes are tracked
                        accurately. As an owner, if your accounting processes are inefficient, you may easily lose track
                        of the project progress, fail to identify cost overruns and develop a lack of confidence from
                        the creditors.
