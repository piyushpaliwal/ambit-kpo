                    <h3>ShareFile authentication</h3>
                    <p>When logging into the Citrix ShareFile web application, you provide your email address and
                        password at your account landing page. After a period of time your session will timeout and you
                        will be prompted to login again. ShareFile Enterprise customers can opt to integrate with Active
                        Directory and redirect this login process.</p>

                    <h4>Secure user access</h4>
                    <p>Each user on an account is given a unique username and password to login. Passwords are hashed so that not even ShareFile employees can access this information. If a user enters an incorrect password five times in a row, the system will lock that user account for five minutes before they can login again.</p>

                    <h4>Network used by ShareFile</h4>
                    <p>ShareFile separates application traffic from file uploads and downloads. ShareFile client applications require access to the ShareFile.com SaaS application as well as access to the storage location for their account. The SaaS application is hosted by Citrix and accessed using a customer-specific URL such as company.sharefile.com or company.sharefile.eu. User account settings, business logic and file metadata are handled by the SaaS application—no files are stored within the SaaS application tier.</p>
